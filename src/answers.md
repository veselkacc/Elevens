Activity 6

1. Replace 5 and 6

2. In order for a win to occur at three cards left, J Q K must be the last three. However there cannot be a losing situation here, in order for the rest of the game to have worked they must be J Q K.

3. There is no strategy to the game due to the random element of which card is selected to fill the empty slots left after replacement. There are only a few ways to actually win, all determined by the draw of the cards.
