Activity 6

1. Replace 5 and 6

2. If the deck has three cards left, there is no way to win if there are three number cards or any combination other than JQK, in order for a win to occur it must be JQK as the last three cards

3. There is no strategy. There can be no strategy based on the fact that the deck is shuffled completely randomly via selection, thus the only way to win is by luck of the draw into cards that are able to be replaced.
